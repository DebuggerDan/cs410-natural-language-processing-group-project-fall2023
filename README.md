CS 410: Natural Language Processing (NLP), Fall 2023, Group #3 Project, PDX

## Brief description of the project

This project seeks to look at the history of the GPT models and how they have improved throughout the years on text summarization. The models we will use are GPT 1, 2, and 3.5. Where in this repo we will observe GPT 1 and GPT 2, and GPT 3.5 will be observed using prompt engineering.

## Overview of the code

The code in this project is really simple from a high level view. There will be an interface that the programmer working on the corresponding model will implement. I.e. preprocessing the data, loading the model, etc.
